Instagram home page clone made with html & css.

Hi there, this is my first project after I learnt on youtube html & css (supersimpledev channel).
I made it just to practice the knowledge that I aqquired.
There were some stuff that I couldnÂ´t resolve as hide the search button and focus on the search bar after doing it.
But overall I think I did a good work.
